need controller class

have model, view, controller for each
ideally
no
want controller to contain both model and view for bomb to access
controller passes reference to bombmodel (and bombview?) to its model and view

==========
create frames first, then make bombmodel, then attach module list to frame
frame (bombview) will use tk grid on each module's canvas
bombmodel will communicate with module controllers
controllers will have binds within canvas for each canvas object (e.g. rectangle)
edgeworkview will have bombmodel reference; bombmodel will trigger the update for edgeworkview if
    strike gets updated.
the timer part of edgeworkview will be constantly refreshed to show the remaining time

import layout:
- app
  - bomb
    -
